Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a budding Backend Engineer specializing in **Java & Spring Boot**. I'm currently honing my skills through hands-on projects and deepening my expertise in **AWS, Docker, Git & GitHub**, and database management.

In addition, I'm practicing LeetCode and am enjoying tackling problems and learning about different quirks and features in programming. You're welcome to take a look at my journey in my `leetcode` [repository](https://github.com/roeishc/leetcode) ✍️

Thanks for stopping by!
